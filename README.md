# Clean Architecture with TypeScript

## FusÃ£o entre: 
- Hexagonal Architecture (a.k.a. Ports And Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
- Onion Architecture
- Screaming Architecture



## DICAS
- Camadas externas devemos criar adaptadores e Portas


- INFRA -> APPLICATION -> DOMAIN
- Camadas externas dependem de camadas mais internas
